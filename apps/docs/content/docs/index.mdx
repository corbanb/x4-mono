## Base URL

All API endpoints are served from:

```
http://localhost:3002/api
```

The tRPC endpoints are available at `/trpc/*` and the REST-like OpenAPI endpoints at `/api/*`.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. Include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  http://localhost:3002/api/users/me
```

See the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) guide for details on obtaining tokens.

## tRPC Client Setup

The x4 API uses tRPC v11. To set up a client in your TypeScript app:

```typescript
import { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from "@trpc/client";
import type { AppRouter } from "@x4/api/router";

const trpc = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpBatchLink({
      url: "http://localhost:3002/trpc",
      headers() {
        return {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## First Request

List all projects (no auth required):

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/projects?limit=10&offset=0
```

Response:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "total": 0,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```
